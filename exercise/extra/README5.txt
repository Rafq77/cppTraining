Exercise "Library"

 - Add getShape(name) to Canvas and Group (no recursion).
   Use unordered_map to find them faster.
   Return a reference to the shape.
   But return as optional (requires reference_wrapper).
 - In demo.cc, make circleWin() void and search for the group to move in
   (last part of) main().

 - Replace sleep by C++11 functions.
